# 🐳 Docker Learnings

Welcome to my **Docker journey** — a collection of notes, experiments, and learnings while exploring one of the most powerful dev tools out there.  

I built this repo to document how I learned Docker from scratch — from understanding containers to building and running my own images.  
If you’re a beginner trying to wrap your head around Docker or just love organized notes, you’ll probably vibe with this.
